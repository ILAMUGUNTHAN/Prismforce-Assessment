step 1 : Initialization

Create a boolean array regenerated of size n (number of enemy circles) initialized to false.
Initialize the number of enemy circles n as the count of elements in enemyPowers.


step 2 : Iterate Over Each Circle

Loop through each circle from 0 to n-1 (inclusive).


step 3 : Regeneration Check for Specific Enemies (k3 and k7)

If the current index i is 2 (k3) or 6 (k7):
  Check if the enemy has not regenerated (!regenerated[i]).
If not regenerated, increase the enemy's power by half of its initial power (enemyPowers[i] += enemyPowers[i] / 2).
  Mark the enemy as regenerated (regenerated[i] = true).


step 4 : Skip Battle Logic

If skipBattles is greater than 0:
  Decrease skipBattles by 1.
  Continue to the next iteration (skip the current battle).


step 5 : Recharge Logic

If rechargeTimes is greater than 0 and Abhimanyu's power (abhimanyuPower) is less than the enemy's power (enemyPowers[i]):
  Recharge Abhimanyu's power by rechargePower.
  Decrease rechargeTimes by 1.


step 6 : Battle Logic

If Abhimanyu's power (abhimanyuPower) is less than the enemy's power (enemyPowers[i]):
  Return false (Abhimanyu loses the battle).
Otherwise:
  Decrease Abhimanyu's power by the enemy's power (abhimanyuPower -= enemyPowers[i]).


step 7 : Attack from Behind by Regenerating Enemies

If the current index i is 3 and the enemy at index 2 has regenerated:
  If Abhimanyu's power is less than the power of the regenerated enemy (enemyPowers[2]):
    Return false (Abhimanyu loses the battle).
  Otherwise:
    Decrease Abhimanyu's power by the regenerated enemy's power (abhimanyuPower -= enemyPowers[2]).
If the current index i is 7 and the enemy at index 6 has regenerated:
  If Abhimanyu's power is less than the power of the regenerated enemy (enemyPowers[6]):
    Return false (Abhimanyu loses the battle).
  Otherwise:
    Decrease Abhimanyu's power by the regenerated enemy's power (abhimanyuPower -= enemyPowers[6]).


step 8 : Completion

If the loop completes and Abhimanyu has crossed all circles, return true.
